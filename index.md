### About Angles

The ANGLES Project is a research project aimed at developing a 
lightweight, online XML code editor, which can support teaching of 
text encoding as well as text encoding research projects, either by 
distributed research teams or at institutions without resources to 
purchase expensive software licenses. By combining the model of 
intensive code development (a.k.a. the "code sprint") with testing 
and feedback by domain experts gathered at nationally-recognized 
disciplinary conferences, the project proposes a bridge between 
humanities centers who have greater resources to program scholarly 
software and the scholars who form the core user community for such 
software through their teaching and research.
